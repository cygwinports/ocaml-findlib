ocaml-findlib
------------------------------------------
The findlib library provides a scheme to manage reusable software 
components (packages), and includes tools that support this scheme. 
Packages are collections of OCaml modules for which metainformation can 
be stored. The packages are kept in the filesystem hierarchy, but with 
strict directory structure. The library contains functions to look the 
directory up that stores a package, to query metainformation about a 
package, and to retrieve dependency information about multiple packages. 
There is also a tool that allows the user to enter queries on the 
command-line. In order to simplify compilation and linkage, there are 
new frontends of the various OCaml compilers that can directly deal with 
packages.

Build instructions:
  unpack ocaml-findlib-1.2.6-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./ocaml-findlib-1.2.6-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/ocaml-findlib-1.2.6-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/ocaml-findlib-1.2.6-X.tar.bz2
